Basic installation
=====================
To install lockindicator-applet into /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/, please type:

./configure
make
make install

The configure file has several options that might be useful. These include:

1. --enable-deb-install: Installing on Ubuntu 9.04+: Versions of Ubuntu greater 
than 9.04 install Python programs automatically into /usr/local, and not /usr.
If the user forces the install into /usr, the support packages are installed 
into /usr/lib/python/site-packages, and not /usr/lib/python/dist-packages. The
former is not in the PYTHONPATH. This is a problem for GNOME applications as 
exporting PYTHONPATH in bash will not work! So the --enable-deb-install is used
to force the package to be installed into dist-packages/ and not site-packages.

2. --prefix: Specify the prefix to install the program to. By default, this is
/usr/local. Please refer to note 1 above about potential issues involved in in-
-stalling it into /usr/.

3. --with-capslock-mask/with-numlock-mask: The xkb library used to determine
 whether the Caps and Num Lock keys are enabled needs to know the masks set by 
Caps and Num Lock keys. While I have verified that the values set by these keys
they may be different on your system. This can be done by typing 
xset q | grep LED
in a terminal, and looking at the result.

The Makefile uses distutils (and a wee bit of setuptools) in the background.
